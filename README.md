# Satellite Imagery Recognition
The objective of this project is to explore the potential of instance segmentation for military vehicles detection in satellite and aerial imagery using transfer learning. The methodology employs
the MLP-ANN & CNN using Data Augmentation and Dropouts and ConvNets. This report aims
to present the results of the experiments conducted, providing an in-depth examination of the approach taken and the underlying thought process.

To analyze the applicability of the Aerial Imagery , we employed the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to distinguish military vehicles . The experimental results show that the training
of deep architectures using the customized/prepared dataset allows to recognize types of military
vehicles.
